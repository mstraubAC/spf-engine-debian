CONFIGURATION

   NOTE: After changing "policy-spf.conf", you should run
   "policy-spf-configtest" to ensure that it's correct.  This only applies
   to changes made to the "policy-spf.conf" master configuration file.

   Configurations are processed from the top down, in the order specified
   by "OTHERCONFIGS".  So, settings in a top-level __default__ file will be
   overridden if set in a configuration below that top level.

   There is the __default__ file at the top level that is used as a
   default for all decisions. If you wish to disable SPF for a specific 
   IP/subnet/sender/recipient, you simply make a __default__ file in a 
   subdirectory under config matching the entity you wish to match, with SPF or 
   other checks disabled.

   For example, if you want to disable SPF queries for hosts in 192.168.10.0/24:

      mkdir /var/spool/policy-spf/config/client_address/192/168/10/
      edit /var/spool/policy-spf/config/client_address/192/168/10/__default__

   The __default__ file should contain:

      SPFSEEDONLY=0
      CHECKERS=
      OTHERCONFIGS=

   Note that for a specific IP address, the last component is a file,
   having the same structure as the __default__.  For example, to block the
   address "10.1.2.3", you would create a file named "3" under the
   directory ".../config/client_address/10/1/2".

   The above sets CHECKERS and OTHERCONFIGS to nothing, so for that subnet
   no checks are done.  All other IP address blocks are still using the top
   level __default__
