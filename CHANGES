#   ! = Changed something significant, or removed a feature
#   * = Fixed a bug, or made a minor improvement

--- 0.5.1 (2007-10-17 14:47 -0400)
  * Corrected regression so reject on Permerror works (introduced in 0.4)
    Thanks to "John A. Martin" <jam@jamux.com> for the bug report.
  * Fixed Restriction Class option to be useful.
  + Made restriction class names configurable
  + Added per user whitelisting README to explain how it's useful
    Thanks to "John A. Martin" <jam@jamux.com> for the contribution.
  * Corrected SPF-Recieved header to us <> for null sender
  * Corrected Postfix integration section of policyd-spf(1) to reflect correct
    policy service time limit name.
  * Corrected installed config file locations in both man pages.
  * Header and logging cleanup (removed trailing ';' and adjusted whitespace).

--- 0.5 (2007-10-03 13:39 -0400)
  + Added man page for configuration file formatting (man 5 policyd-spf.conf) 
  * Moved explicit logging of the result headers for HELO and Mail From from
    debug level 1 to debug level 2 (SPF results are already logged at debug
    level 1)
  * Moved config file item logging to a new debug level 5.  This should only be
    needed for development and not for operational use.
  ! Shifted list of local addresses to skip SPF from hard coded to a config
    option.
  * Changed default (no config file) TempError defer to False to match docs and
    default in config file.
  ! Refactored Whitelisting/SPF skipping code for reduced size and better
    extensibility and maintainability.
  + Added Forwarder Domain SPF Whitelist
  + Added Restriction Class mode to return only SPF result to Postfix
  + Return link to SPF "Why" page for reject/defer actions.

--- 0.4.1 (2007-08-13 11:00 -0400)
  * Correct multi-recipient caching to work for multi-recipient rejections

  + Process HELO first and reject if allowed before looking up Mail From
  + Log failure to find SPF library
  ! Rationalize text of logging and comments back to Postfix - any script that
    parses logs from this program automatically will need to be updated.
  * Remove obsolete code for using non-Python SPF libraries
  + Activate support for config files (refactored legacy code)
  ! Change PermError default from Reject to Prepend
    - Reject on PermError was inconsistent with traditional SPF usage.
  ! Remove obsolete undistributed files from SVN trunk
  ! Remove INSTALL file (redundant to man 1 policyd-spf)
  * Adjust master.cf recommendations in INSTALL for new recommendations from
    Weitse Venema (postfix-users mailing list).
  * Change indentation from tabs to spaces in legacy code
  + Support case insensitive SPF results as required by RFC 4408.
  + SPF results reported with initial capitalization.

  * Fixed processing to skip SPF for localhost connections to work for IPv6
  + Implemented prepending of SPF-Received: header.
  + Added man page (man 1 policyd-spf)

--- 0.2 (2007-02-07 16:50)
  * Changed skip local connections to use CIDR match rather than string.
  * Log non-fail/error results to syslog

--- 0.1 (2007-01-17 18:00)

  ! Initial release
  ! Removed greylisting
  ! Stubbed out config files until they can be updated and integrated
