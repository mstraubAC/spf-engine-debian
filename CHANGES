  * Pre-initialize helo_result to None to avoid crash if HELO checking is
    disabled
--- 0.6 (2008-02-20 16:35 -0500)

    lists

    and SMTP replies

    documentation updates

  + Added man page for configuration file formatting (man 5 policyd-spf.conf)

    debug level 1 to debug level 2 (SPF results are already logged at debug
    level 1)

    needed for development and not for operational use.

    option.
  * Changed default (no config file) TempError defer to False to match docs and
    default in config file.

    extensibility and maintainability.
