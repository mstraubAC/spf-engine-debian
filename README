=================

This is python-policyd-spf, an external policy checker for the postfix mail
server.  It will use pyspf to check SPF records to determine if email should 
be rejected by your server.

To install from the tar.gz (is this software has been packaged for your 
distribution, the packaged version is recommended and should be installed using
your normal distribution packaging tools):

1.  Extract the package from the tarball (tar -xvvzf ...)
2.  Enter the package directory (cd ...)
3.  python setup.py build
4.  As root python setup.py install

The pyspf (python-spf) library version 2.0 or higher is required for this 
policy server.  If it's not available through your packaging system, it can be
downloaded from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pymilter/

Nothing is configured by default, so this will not interact with Postfix until
it has been set up.

See man 1 policyd-spf for information on setting up and using this policy
server.

See man 5 policyd-spf.conf for configuration file information.
